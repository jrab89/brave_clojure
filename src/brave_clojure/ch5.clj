;; 1. You used (comp :intelligence :attributes) to create a function that returns a characterâ€™s intelligence. Create a new function, attr, that you can call like (attr :intelligence) and that does the same thing.
;; 2. Implement the comp function.
;; 3. Implement the assoc-in function. Hint: use the assoc function and define its parameters as [m [k & ks] v].
;; 4. Look up and use the update-in function.
;; 5. Implement update-in.
